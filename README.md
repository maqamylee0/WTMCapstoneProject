## Brief

This project is the final project for the Women Techster Mobile App Bootcamp.

I got to implement concepts like state management using providers and how to make to-the-dot user interfaces.
I also learned about how to properly structure code and separate logic from views.
I also learned managed to implement logic to add functionalities such as how to cancel appointments.
